## Supported `starknet-hardhat-plugin` version

`package.json` is fixed to use the latest `starknet-hardhat-plugin` version this example repository is synced with.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues trying to use this example repo with the Starknet plugin, try running `npm install` or `npm update`, as it may be due to version mismatch in the dependencies.

## Branches

- `master` - latest stable examples
- `plugin` - used for testing by [Starknet Hardhat Plugin](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin)

### Branch updating (for developers)

- New PRs and features should be targeted to the `plugin` branch.
- After releasing a new plugin version, `master` should ideally be reset (fast forwarded) to `plugin` (less ideally merged).
